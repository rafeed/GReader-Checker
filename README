GReader-Checker: v1.00
The GReader-Checker extension for Safari 5 is based off of the work of both Victor Adrée and Alejandro JL. I combined both of their codes and implemented my own icons and settings to give the best user experience when using the extension. I based my icons off of Matt Brett’s RSS feed icon.

What GReader-Checker does:
- Updates a toolbar icon when there is a new feed item in Google Reader.
- This updates you on your total unread count.

What GReader-Checker might do in the future:
- Allow you to pick which feeds you want to be updated.
- Enter a custom update time

Why should you use GReader-Checker?
- It works
- It’s pretty
- It has more options than others out there

How to Install:
